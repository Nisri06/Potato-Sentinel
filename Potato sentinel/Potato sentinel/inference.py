CLASS_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    'Potato___Early_blight': 'Early blight, caused by the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani, presents a significant challenge to potato cultivation. This disease typically manifests as dark, circular lesions that appear on the older leaves, gradually expanding and developing concentric rings, resembling target patterns. As the infection progresses, the affected leaves exhibit yellowing around the lesions and may become brittle, leading to premature leaf drop. This deterioration severely impairs the plant’s photosynthetic efficiency, resulting in reduced vigor and crop yield. Favorable conditions for early blight include warm temperatures and high humidity, making it essential to implement proactive management strategies, such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, and timely fungicide applications, to mitigate its impact.',
    'Potato___healthy': 'Late blight, an exceptionally destructive disease caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is notorious for its rapid and devastating effects on potato crops. The disease typically begins with water-soaked lesions on leaves, which can quickly escalate into large, dark patches with fuzzy, grayish-white fungal growth underneath. Late blight can affect all plant parts, including stems and tubers, leading to extensive losses in both quality and quantity. This pathogen thrives in cool, moist conditions, making it particularly menacing during wet weather. The swift progression of late blight can result in total crop failure within a matter of days. Effective management is paramount, involving the use of resistant potato varieties, strategic fungicide applications, and careful monitoring of environmental conditions to prevent outbreaks.',
    'Potato___Late_blight': 'Healthy potato leaves are the hallmark of robust plant growth and development. These leaves are characterized by a vibrant green color, indicating strong photosynthetic activity and overall plant vitality. The surface is smooth and free from blemishes or lesions, reflecting an absence of disease and pest infestation. Healthy leaves are well-structured, providing optimal spacing for air circulation, which reduces humidity and the risk of fungal infections. They are crucial for energy production and nutrient absorption, directly correlating with tuber yield. Maintaining leaf health involves diligent cultural practices, including appropriate irrigation, fertilization, and pest management, all of which contribute to sustaining the overall health and productivity of the potato crop.'
